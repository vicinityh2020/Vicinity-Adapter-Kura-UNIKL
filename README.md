# VICINITY Kura Adapter
### Eclipse Kura: Introduction
Eclipse Kura is an Eclipse IoT project that provides a platform for building IoT gateways. It is a smart application container that enables remote management of such gateways and provides a wide range of APIs for allowing you to write and deploy your own IoT application. This open source Java and OSGi (Open Services Gateway initiative)-based framework simplify the design, deployment and remote management of embedded applications.
Kura runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and leverages OSGi, a dynamic component system for Java, to simplify the process of writing reusable software building blocks. It offers API access to the hardware interfaces of IoT Gateways (serial ports, GPS, watchdog, GPIOs, I2C, etc.). It also offers OSGI bundle to simplify the management of network configurations, the communication with IoT servers, and the remote management of the gateway.
